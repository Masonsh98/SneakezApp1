## Overview
### Description
Allows users to share collectoin and reach out to people that interenst in selling shoes at their current shoes event.
   - **Market:** Anyone that takes pictures could enjoy this app. Ability to follow and hashtag based on interests and categories allows users with unique interests to engage with relevant content.
   - **Habit:** Users can post throughout the day many times. Features like "Stories" encourage more candid posting as well. Users can explore endless pictures in any category imaginable whenever they want. Very habbit forming!

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Music
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users music choices, and connects them to other users with similar choices. The user can then decide to message this person and befriend them if wanted.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with pairing people based on music taste, then perhaps this could evolve into a music sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.
